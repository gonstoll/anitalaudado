              I'm Ana, a Product and Visual designer specialised in UI and
              Design Systems.

              Originally from Ushuaia, Argentina, also known as the southernmost
              city in the world. At a young age I moved to the other side of the
              country to follow my passion for art, illustration and design,
              where I got my bachelor in Graphic Design. I've worked as a Visual
              Designer and UI/UX Designer in some of the most recognizable
              design and digital agencies.
              <br />
              <br />
              Following that direction, a few years ago I sold everything and
              moved to the complete opposite hemisphere to continue my
              adventure. And that's exactly what I'm doing here in beautiful
              Copenhagen, where I work as a Product Designer specialised in
              Design Systems.
              <br />
              <br />
              When I'm not designing or drawing I love experimenting in the
              kitchen, growing my indoor jungle, exploring new places and trying
              to catch some live music.
